I am Oded Stein, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California's
[Viterbi School of Engineering][viterbi] where I lead the [Geometry and Graphics Group (GGG)][ggg].
You can contact me at **ostein@usc.edu**.
My office is GCS 202N.

If you want to work with me as an undergraduate intern, a graduate student,
or a postdoc, please visit [this page][apply] for more information.

My interests include geometry processing, numerical mathematics and optimization, simulation, differential geometry and algebraic topology. If it has anything to do with geometry, I am interested!

You can find my list of publications [here][publications].

Academia in computer science and mathematics can be complicated to navigate for
newcomers.
If you have any questions about how to plan your academic career,
how to apply for grad school, how to get research internships, or anything of
the like, feel free to email me if you think my advice might be useful.

## Short biography
<!-- Oded Stein received a BSc in Mathematics in 2013 and a MSc in Mathematics in
2015 from ETH Zurich under the supervision of
Ralf Hiptmair of the [Seminar for Applied Mathematics][sam].
He was awarded the ETH Excellence Scholarship for his Master's studies and earned a distinction for his MSc degree.
He interned at [Pixar research][pixarresearch] in 2017. -->
Oded Stein recieved his PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2020 from Columbia University
under the supervision of Eitan Grinspun for his research of smoothness energies
in geometry processing.
From 2020 to 2022 he was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT's
[Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab][csail] with the gracious
support of the [Swiss National Science Foundation][snf]'s Early Postdoc.Mobility
fellowship.
Since 2023 Oded Stein is an Assistant Professor at USC's Viterbi School of
Engineering.
Oded Stein has won the [2025 SIAM Geometric Design Early Career Prize][siamearlycareer], and his geometry processing library Gpytoolbox has won the [2025 SGP software award][sgpsoftwareaward].
