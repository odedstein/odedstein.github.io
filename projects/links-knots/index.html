    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
We examine the application of algebraic knot theory to the physical
    simulation of curves in space in the context of computer graphics and
    physical simulation.
    In the first part, the classical linking number of Gauss is generalized
    to open curves, and a method is presented to efficiently compute these
    linking numbers as well as optimize them (based on the work of
    Qinami and Grinspun [2017]).
In the second part, we present a method to compute the Vassiliev invariants
    of closed curves in R3, and explore a strategy to manipulate
    closed curves in space to
    achieve desired knot invariants, as well as use Vassiliev invariants for
    contact simulation.
    Preliminary results of applications to curves in R3
    are shown.
