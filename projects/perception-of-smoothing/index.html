								<h2>Abstract</h2>
								<p>
									We conduct a controlled crowd-sourced experiment of COVID-19 case data visualization to study if and how different plotting methods, time windows, and the nature of the data influence people's interpretation of real-world COVID-19 data and people's prediction of how the data will evolve in the future.
									We find that a 7-day backward average smoothed line successfully reduces the distraction of periodic data patterns compared to just unsmoothed bar data.
									Additionally, we find that the presence of a smoothed line helps readers form a consensus on how the data will evolve in the future.
									We also find that the fixed 7-day smoothing window size leads to different amounts of perceived recurring patterns in the data depending on the time period plotted -- this suggests that varying the smoothing window size together with the plot window size might be a promising strategy to influence the perception of spurious patterns in the plot.
