# Apply to work with me!

I am a faculty at USC's [Viterbi School of Engineering][viterbi], and
I am often looking for bright researchers to work with me.
If you are interested in geometry, numerical mathematics, or computer graphics,
you should consider applying!

## I am an undergraduate or masters student and interested in a research internship.

I can currently not offer any research internships for undergraduate or masters students
who are not already students at USC.
If you are a USC student, I encourage you to take any graphics classes with me, Prof. Barbic, or Prof. Neumann, do well, and then email me telling me about it!
This is the best way to start a research project with my research group group.

## I am interested in pursuing a PhD.

_I am currently not looking to advise any new PhD students.
Please come back next year!_

This is a great idea.
If you have a university degree, and are interested in pursuing a PhD with a
focus in one of my research areas, you can apply to USC Viterbi's graduate
school and be advised by me (if I'm looking for students this year).
To apply for a PhD, you have to...
* Apply to [USC Viterbi's graduate school in computer science][gradschoolapp].
Make sure you apply for a PhD in Computer Science.
* Write a cover letter that mentions me by name, and explains why your background
and your interests make you a good fit for me.
Read up on some of my [publications][publications] to get a feel for my
research interests.
* Contact me by email at **ostein@usc.edu** to tell me about your application!

Feel free to email me before you submit an application at **ostein@usc.edu**,
if you want to apply to USC.
We can talk about whether graduate school is right for you, and plan the
application process.
Do not worry if you are a nontraditional student, feel free to approach me!

## I already have a PhD and want to do a postdoc.

If you have a PhD, and have published research in an area that is relevant
to my research interests, please email me at **ostein@usc.edu** directly with
a short introduction, a link to your work, and a link to your PhD thesis.
We can then set up a conversation to discuss how an application for a postdoc
position works.
