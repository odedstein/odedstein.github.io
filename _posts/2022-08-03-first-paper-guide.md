Writing your first scientific computer graphics paper is a difficult task.
Beyond the technical and scientific questions, there is a lot of procedural and
writing knowledge needed that is not readily accessible in one location.
I and others from SIGGRAPH RCDC have published a series of guides on how to
write your first paper for ACM SIGGRAPH / TOG.
Check it out here:

## I have finished a research project, now what?

Completing a research project in computer graphics is very difficult.
If you have finished a research project and are now thinking about submitting
it to a scientific conference / journal, this blog post is for you.

First of all, congratulations!
You have made a novel contribution to science.
Thanks!
It now remains to write up your contribution in a scientific paper.
Writing a scientific paper is a skill in and of itself that you need to learn
in addition to learning how to conduct research.
In order to write an article for a computer graphics audience at ACM SIGGRAPH or
for ACM Transactions on Graphics there are lots of rules you need to follow.
These rules are both written and unwritten, and dispersed in a wide variety of
places all over the internet.
I and a few other experienced ACM SIGGRAPH / TOG technical paper authors have
created a series of guides to help newcomers write their first technical paper.
I hope that this guide will help you to write your technical paper, and to
showcase your work to the computer graphics community.

Our guide can be found here:

Please share this guide with your collaborators, your students, and your
coworkers.
If you are an experienced technical papers author yourself, and you want to
